Section 294 of the Indian Penal Code


If you are found involved in obscene activity at a public place, you can be imprisoned for 3 months.

But in the absence of exact definition of obscene activity police has always misused this act.

Sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine, or with both.

Indian Penal Code lays down the punishment for obscene acts or words in public.

The other sections of Indian Penal code which deal with obscenity are 292 and 293. The law does not clearly define what would constitute an obscene act, but it would enter the domain of the state only when it takes place in a public place to the annoyance of others.

Temple art or nakedness of sadhus are traditionally outside the purview of this section.

Kiss of Love Protesters were threatened with lawsuits under this section.
