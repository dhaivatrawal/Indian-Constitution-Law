Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, Section 14


If you are living in Delhi then your land lord does not have the right to forcefully vacate your house without giving prior notice to you.

The Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 is beneficial as also restrictive in nature. The courts are under a legal compulsion to harmoniously read the provisions of the Act so as to balance the rights of the landlord and the obligations of the tenant toward each other keeping in mind that one of the subjects of the legislature while enacting the Act was to curb the tendancy of the greedy landlords to throw out the tenants, paying lower rent, in the name of personal occupation and rent out the premises at the market rate.
