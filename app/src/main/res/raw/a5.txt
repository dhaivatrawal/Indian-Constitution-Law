Motor Vehicle Act, 1988


As per the Section 129 of the Indian Motor Vehicle Act, wearing the helmet is must for two wheeler riders.

Section 128 of this Motor Vehicle Act limits maximum two riders on the bikes.

This law also says that if the traffic police officer snatches the key from the car or motorcycle, it is illegal. You have the full right to launch a Legal proceeding against the officer.

Indian Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act,2017

This will be a significant upgrade to the motor vehicle laws.

It envisages body cams on traffic cops and RTO officials to check corruption and 7-year imprisonment instead of current 2 years for drink-driving deaths, mandatory 3rd party insurance for all vehicles, and stiffer penalties for traffic violations to reduce the accident rates.

However due to frequent disruptions in Rajya Sabha and lack of support from Indian National Congress, the bill failed to turn into act and lapsed after the conclusion of interim budget session and on the account of general elections.
